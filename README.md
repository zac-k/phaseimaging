# phaseimaging

## Introduction
This library provides a variety of functions related to phase imaging. Additionally, classes and their associated methods are included for if an object-oriented approach is preferred. Some of the included functions and methods can be used to process experimental images, but I have also included functions to simulate these images. For experimental data, pre-processing will be required for meaningful results. In the future, I will add image registration and other preprocessing functions to enable perfoming all steps after image acquisition using only this library.

Note that although I have coded most of the functions to allow for rectangular images and specimen arrays, most of my testing has used square and cubic arrays, so there is a potential for bugs if you are using rectangular arrays. Please let me know if you experience any issues with any of the functions.

## Functions
### import_specimen
Generates a 3D numpy array from a specimen file. Input format is a text file (sans the file extension) with each block of rows/columns representing a 2D slice of the binary specimen mask. Each block is separated by an empty line. Specimen files can be generated using my [random-specimen-generator](https://github.com/zac-k/random-specimen-generator) repository. One specimen file is included in the present repository as an example.

    import_specimen(specimen_file)

|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters: | **specimen_file**:*string* |  |
|  |  | Path of specimen file |
| Returns: | **specimen**:*ndarray* |  |
|  |  | Three-dimensional binary specimen mask. A value of `1` indicates a voxel where the specimen exists, and a value of `0` indicates a voxel where it does not. |
|  |  |  |

Note: Does not yet support rectangular (non-cubic) arrays.
