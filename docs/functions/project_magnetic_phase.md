### phaseimaging.project_magnetic_phase

Generate a phase map by projecting the magnetic vector potential of the specimen in the z-direction.

    phaseimaging.project_magnetic_phase(specimen, mhat, magnetisation, image_width, k_kernel=None, inverse_k_squared_kernel=None)

|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters: | **specimen** : *array_like* |  |
|  |  | Three-dimensional binary specimen mask. |
|  | **mhat** : *tuple*, *list* |  |
|  |  | Magnetisation direction. A vector pointing in the direction of uniform magnetisation of the specimen. The length of this vector has no effect. It is advisable to use a unit vector for clarity. |
|  | **magnetisation** : *float* |  |
|  |  | Magnitude of the uniform magnetisation in A/m. |
|  | **image_width** : *tuple*, *list* |  |
|  |  | Three element tuple or list containing the width of the specimen array in metres, in the x-, y-, and z-direction, respectively. |
|  | **k_kernel** : *ndarray*, *optional* |  |
|  |  | Kernel of k-space vectors at z = 0. This can be saved from previous calculations provided that the size and resolution are the same. If this parameter is omitted, it will be generated by this function. |
|  | **inverse_k_squared_kernel** : *ndarray*, *optional* |  |
|  |  | Regularised inverse k^2 array. This can be saved from previous calculations provided that the size and resolution are the same. If this parameter is omitted, it will be generated by this function using the default regularisation parameter. |
| Returns: | **phase** : *ndarray* |  |
|  |  | Real, two-dimensional numpy array. The computed phase map. |
