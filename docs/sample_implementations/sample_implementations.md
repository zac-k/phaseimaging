## Sample implementations

Here are two different implementations (procedural and object-oriented) of the same simulation and reconstruction process, to help you get started with using this library. These scripts load a specimen from the included specimen file, project the electrostatic and magnetic phases, simulate a through-focal series of intensities, retrieve the phase using the TIE, compare the exact and retrieved phases using a normalised root-mean-square error metric, and plot all the relevant images. They are also available in the [README directory](/README) of this repository, where they are updated more regularly, so it is advisable to use those directly instead of copying and pasting from here.
